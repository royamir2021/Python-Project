<h3>Project Overview</h3>
<p>In this project, you will take on the role of a Data Scientist / Data Analyst for a new startup investment firm that helps customers invest in stocks. Your task is to extract financial data, such as historical share prices and quarterly revenue reports, from various sources using Python libraries and web scraping. You'll be working with popular stocks, including Tesla, Amazon, AMD, and GameStop. Once you collect the data, you'll visualize it in a dashboard to identify patterns and trends.</p>

<h3>Dashboard Analytics Displayed</h3>
<be>
<p>A dashboard provides a clear view of key performance indicators (KPIs). You will practice analyzing data sets and extracting KPIs, using prompts to guide you in accessing and displaying data in dashboards. This project will teach you how to display KPIs on a dashboard using Plotly for data visualization.</p>

<h3>hTools and Environment</h3>
<be>
<p>In the "Python for Data Science, AI, and Development" course, you used Skills Network Labs for hands-on labs. For this project, you will use both Skills Network Labs and Watson Studio.</p>

<p>Skills Network Labs: A sandbox environment for learning and completing labs.</p>
<p>Watson Studio: Part of IBM Cloud Pak for Data, offering tools and a collaborative environment for data scientists, data analysts, AI and machine learning engineers, and domain experts to develop and deploy projects.</p>
<h3>Review Criteria</h3>
<be>
<p>You will complete two hands-on labs on Extracting Stock Data and one assignment. Your performance will be evaluated based on two quizzes and one peer review assignment. The quizzes will test your understanding of the labs' output, and in the peer review assignment, you will share and take screenshots of your assignment outcomes.<p>
